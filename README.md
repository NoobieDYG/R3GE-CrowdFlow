# 🚀 CrowdFlow

> From Turbulence to Tranquility: Crowd as Smooth as Water with Ai

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Problem Statement 1 - Weave AI Magic with Groq

---

## 🎯 Objective

CrowdFlow addresses the critical need for real-time crowd density monitoring in public spaces, festivals, religious gatherings, and events. It assists the authorities/organizers/safety personnel in proactively identifying high-risk zones to prevent stampedes and overcrowding.

Brief real-world use case:
Imagine a festival or a piligrimage (Mahakumbh or Hajj) with thousands of attendees — CrowdFlow visually monitors the scene, detects density in zones, and offers live insights + spoken alerts to improve crowd management.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`R3GE`

### Team Members:  
- Affaan Jaweed (https://www.linkedin.com/in/affaanjaweed/) 
- Farhan Khan (https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhan-khan-668439300/)

- Syed Aamir (https://www.linkedin.com/in/syed-aamir-8b5591300/)

### Your Approach:  
Why we chose this problem:
Crowd-related disasters are very catastrophic and are uninevitable BUT can be prevented with timely data. We wanted to blend AI vision, real-time feedback, and interactivity to help reduce risks and assist authorities with actionable insights.

Key challenges we addressed:
Real-time processing of crowd video streams
Accurate person detection and zone heatmapping
Communication via both chat and speech
Dynamic zone risk assessment

Pivots or breakthroughs:
Used CSRNet instead of YOLO for accurate data
Integrated GROQ LLM for contextual zone suggestions
Built custom zone-wise heatmap and TTS flow
Shifted from basic overlays to intelligent AI commentary
